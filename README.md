# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for each year.

Do not expect good code herein! I use AoC problems to toy with ideas and languages. E.g., I spent some of 2021 trying to re-learn `c`. Or, for example, I will use a problem as an excuse to try to working only (or at least *mostly*) with functional set/array concepts (map, reduce, filter) in place of loops.

And, if 2021 is any indication, I'll find a tangent halfway through AoC again in 2022 and spend the remainder of AoC trying to learn a new space more deeply.
